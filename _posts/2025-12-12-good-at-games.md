Somebody on /vr/ is absolutely desperate for attention and dug up some post from the /vr/ archives about seeking challenge. You can tell they've been trying to make this thread work for a while because they've got a ctrl-f highlight in the screenshot, a red oval around the inflammatory remark about challenge, and a red dot between the paragraphs so the image was unique (i.e., the thread they made sunk to the last page but didn't get pruned since /vr/ is a naturally slow board).

The main point the true OP (from 2021) is that there's a sizable audience of people who play "difficult" games not for the thrill of the difficulty itself but for the social clout of having done so as a way to separate themselves from the average gamer. Funny irony is that [the OP of the most recent thread](https://warosu.org/vr/thread/12185297) does little more than seek attention for the social clout of having beaten the in-game record for a level of Donkey Kong Country.

Despite the basic argumentation in the thread, I think seeking challenge is interesting philosophically, even though philosophically might be too loaded of a word.

# Challenge is important

- Challenge is inherently mental exercise, and the brain is a muscle; use it or lose it
- Literally keeping yourself sharp by thinking up and testing strategies, learning things about game mechanics, and practicing mechanical skills
- Tackling challenges does make you "better" in the vein of learning and overcoming, but it loses its edge when used as a social cudgel instead of a social sieve

- Challenge as a social sieve means you tend to connect with driven high-caliber people more often; you self-select as a doer, an explorer
    - There's something about making the jump from being a member of a fandom to a real hobbyist here

# Challenge is different for everyone

- Most people who play video games are competent enough to do other challenging things; sometimes the other challenging things they do are more taxing
- The OP from the image makes the fatal mistake of assigning challenge to a narrow category of rote execution
- Challenge can be mental
    - "Casual" games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, have challenge via aesthetics, imagination, and planning; how do you design a good looking dream home/farm?
    - Traditional roguelikes and Mystery Dungeon games don't involve much mechanical skill but are heavily dependent both on forethought and deep thought
- Challenge can be mechanical
    - 1 credit clears of arcade games, mostly shmups, require a lot of dexterity and practice
    - Older fighting games have technical characters have a similar requirement of dexterity and practice
- Challenge can be both mental and mechanical
    - The 1v1 Triumverate (Arena FPS, RTS, and Fighting Games) at a "competitive" level or when taken seriously require development of mechanical skill, playing to practice, review of prior games, development of strategy for both offense and defense, and development of "gamesense" (gut feeling based on prior experience)
- Challenge can be social
    - Achievement hunting groups go so far as to organize events to revive dead multiplayer games to unlock rare achievements

## Challenge is opinionated

- Some types of challenge are inherently more shallow than others; planning & aesthetics only go so far in games like Stardew Valley
- I personally think speedrunning is very shallow
    - shaving single-digit seconds from consecutive runs is rote memorization
    - using exploits to shave single-digit seconds from runs is not just rote memorization but avoiding the main gameplay
    - inherently limited by nature in that games require specialists; mechanical skill does not carry
    - interestingly, there was some bickering about this very viewpoint in the thread
- When I was playing 6s tf2, people balked at the idea of the game they played for fun being "taken seriously"

# Balance in all things

- The OP in the image does have a point; people who seek challenge for status are always going to be chasing status versus development; this will create a cycle of frustration
- Consequently, we will always run into someone who seeks challenge for status; for the safety of your own enjoyment, cut them off
    - The experience of seeking challenge should be shared positively as those who seek it out are a much smaller group
    - Unfortunately, the warm fuzzies of supporting each other in challenging endeavors are usually short-lived or nonexistent: https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/27/the-loneliness-of-the-low-ranking-tennis-player
- We all have a limited amount of energy we can devote to things; chasing challenge in every facet of your life invites extreme burnout and psychic damage
    - Chasing challenge constantly impacts your ability to understand the positions of others who seek more casual interactions with an activity
- Some things are extremely challenging but have no reward outside of a dopamine hit; know when it's fine to go "nah this ain't it"
    - Time is a limited resource for all of us and people don't realize it until a lot of it is gone
    - Challenge should lead somewhere and enrich your life; getting "the shiny gold medal" on time attack is great if it has personal meaning to you, but do you really want to piss away your life playing Hell Let Loose just to reach Career Level 450?
    - Example, playing 6s TF2 was not only a challenge with ups and downs but connected me with amazing people and even decided my career path
    - Example, many high-level fighting game players have been able to pivot to other fighting games AND develop sources of income from teaching others the nuances of fighting games at a "serious" level

# Closing thoughts

- Seeking challenge in general, not just in video games, is important for keeping a sharp mind and helping you cultivate a social circle of motivated fellows. However, do not forget the golden rule of **have fun**. Seek challenge for the right reasons.
- We all have limited time, so if you truly enjoy something and want to push it to the next level, do it and cultivate it. Maybe good aesthetic farm and house design in Stardew Valley is your challenge and calling.
- Despite my personal opinion, if speedrunning is that challenging thing for you, go for it.
- Conversely, if you feel satisfied just breezing through platformers without doing any of the "hard" stuff, that's fine too. Anyone who holds some "shiny gold" time attack medal over you as a social cudgel sucks as a person anyway, fuck 'em.
