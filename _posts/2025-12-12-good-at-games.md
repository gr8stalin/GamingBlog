Somebody on /vr/ is absolutely desperate for attention and dug up some post from the /vr/ archives about seeking challenge. You can tell they've been trying to make this thread work for a while because they've got a ctrl-f highlight in the screenshot, a red oval around the inflammatory remark about challenge, and a red dot between the paragraphs so the image was unique (i.e., the thread they made sunk to the last page but didn't get pruned since /vr/ is a naturally slow board).

The main point the true OP (from 2021) is that there's a sizable audience of people who play "difficult" games not for the thrill of the difficulty itself but for the social clout of having done so as a way to separate themselves from the average gamer. Funny irony is that [the OP of the most recent thread](https://warosu.org/vr/thread/12185297) does little more than seek attention for the social clout of having beaten the in-game record for a level of Donkey Kong Country.

Despite the basic argumentation in the thread, I think seeking challenge is interesting philosophically, even though philosophically might be too loaded of a word.

# Challenge is important

- Challenge is inherently mental exercise, and the brain is a muscle; use it or lose it
- Literally keeping yourself sharp by thinking up and testing strategies, learning things about game mechanics, and practicing mechanical skills
- Tackling challenges does make you "better" in the vein of learning and overcoming, but it loses its edge when used as a social cudgel instead of a social sieve
- Challenge as a social sieve means you tend to connect with driven high-caliber people more often; you self-select as a doer, an explorer

# Challenge is different for everyone

- Most people who play video games are competent enough to do other challenging things; sometimes the other challenging things they do are more taxing
- The OP from the image makes the fatal mistake of assigning challenge to a narrow category of rote execution
- Challenge can be mental
    - "Casual" games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, have challenge via aesthetics, imagination, and planning; how do you design a good looking dream home/farm?
    - Traditional roguelikes and Mystery Dungeon games don't involve much mechanical skill but are heavily dependent both on forethought and deep thought
- Challenge can be mechanical
    - 1 credit clears of arcade games, mostly shmups, require a lot of dexterity and practice
    - Older fighting games have technical characters have a similar requirement of dexterity and practice
- Challenge can be both mental and mechanical
    - The 1v1 Triumverate (Arena FPS, RTS, and Fighting Games) at a "competitive" level or when taken seriously require development of mechanical skill, playing to practice, review of prior games, development of strategy for both offense and defense, and development of "gamesense" (gut feeling based on prior experience)
- Challenge can be social
    - Achievement hunting groups go so far as to organize events to revive dead multiplayer games to unlock rare achievements

## Challenge is opinionated

- Some types of challenge are inherently more shallow than others; planning & aesthetics only go so far in games like Stardew Valley
- I personally think speedrunning is very shallow
    - shaving single-digit seconds from consecutive runs is rote memorization
    - using exploits to shave single-digit seconds from runs is not just rote memorization but avoiding the main gameplay
    - inherently limited by nature in that games require specialists; mechanical skill does not carry

# Balance in all things

- The OP in the image does have a point; people who seek challenge for status are always going to be chasing status versus development; this will create a cycle of frustration
